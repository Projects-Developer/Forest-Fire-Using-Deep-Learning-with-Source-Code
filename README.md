## Abstract:
Forest fires pose a significant threat to the environment, wildlife, and human lives. Early detection and response are crucial to preventing the spread of fires. This study proposes a deep learning-based forest fire detection system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The system is trained on a dataset of images of forest fires and non-fire images, achieving high accuracy in detecting fires. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting forest fires, even in challenging environmental conditions. This system has the potential to provide early warnings and prevent the spread of forest fires, ultimately reducing the risk of damage to the environment and human lives.

Keywords: Forest Fire Detection, Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Early Warning System, Environmental Monitoring, Wildland Fire Management.
